**Java command line music player for playing your favorite songs.**

Java Music Player is a Java program that plays music selected by the user 
or different playlist sources (files, strings, shuffled, all songs) and 
displays the corresponding song artwork. Moreover, users can add more songs 
and artwork by putting them in the corresponding folders with the standard 
file name extensions specified, and then adding them to their "songlist" 
of choice. This allows for a simple and easy to use command line music player.

displayed, and (file name #) is the file name of the corresponding music and
artwork file.
Also, (file name) does not include the file extension, it is just the
base name, and the first two lines are devoted to the exiting option
where the second line MUST be the word "exit", with out quotes. ALL
lines end with a newline EXCEPT for the last one.
